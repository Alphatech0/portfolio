            <h3>What is Grasshopper?</h3>
            <p>Grasshopper is the best way to learn to code for beginners. With fun, quick lessons on your phone or desktop, 
                Grasshopper teaches adult learners to write real JavaScript. It’s currently available free of charge on Desktop 
                and Android. Grasshopper is a Code with Google program.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fag-2">
            <h3>What can I expect to learn using Grasshopper?</h3>
            <p>Grasshopper covers the foundations of JavaScript, how to create animations with code, 
                teaches solving problem techniques needed for technical interviews and introduces 
                how to build a website with HTML and CSS. Here’s what each course covers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fundamentals - How code works, calling functions, variables, strings, 
                        for loops, arrays, conditionals, operators, objects, and how all these things 
                        work together.</li>
                    <li>Fundamentals II - String and array methods, creating functions, introducing 
                        recursion and callbacks, and importing libraries.</li>
                    <li>Intro to Interviewing - Decompose and model real world problems so that 
                        they can be solved using code, utilizing computational thinking.</li>
                    <li>Animations I - Drawing shapes using the popular D3 library, 
                        defining functions, callback functions, and animations.</li>
                    <li>Animations II - Creating more complex functions using D3 and 
                        integrating JavaScript features.</li>
                    <li>Array Methods - Using multiple JavaScript array methods, 
                        such as indexOf, shift, includes, splice, map and reduce.</li>
                    <li>Using a Code Editor - Introduction to a traditional style code editor (or IDE)</li>
                    <li>Intro to Webpages - Covers basic HTML and CSS, then uses JavaScript to build an interactive webpage.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By the end of using Grasshopper’s current curriculum, 
                    you should be familiar with core programming concepts, be 
                    comfortable solving problems with code and be able to build a simple webpage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fag-2">
            <h3>What should I do after I use Grasshopper?</h3>
            <p>The world is your oyster! Grasshopper should give you the foundational skills 
                you need to continue your journey in learning to code, which can take many 
                different routes. We have users who pursue full time coding bootcamps, part time 
                online coursework, degrees at 4 year universities or community colleges, and more. 
                That said, if you’re looking for a recommendation, we’ve put together some suggested 
                next steps here.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fag-2">
            <h3>Does the little grasshopper in the lessons have a name?</h3>
            <p>The grasshopper’s name is Grace! The name Grasshopper pays honor to 
                Grace Hopper, one of the early pioneers in computer programming.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fag-2">
            <h3>Who is the team building Grasshopper?</h3>
            <p>Grasshopper is a Code with Google Program, a workshop for experimental projects. 
                Our entire team is passionate about removing barriers to accessing coding education, 
                and we love working on Grasshopper. To find out more, check out our About Us page.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fag-2">
            <h3>Will Grasshopper remain free of charge to use?</h3>
            <p>Yes! We firmly believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn to code, 
                regardless of their means. We’re committed to keeping Grasshopper free of charge to use.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fag-2">
            <h3>Should I expect more lessons? What will it be?</h3>
            <p>We’re constantly working on expanding our curriculum. In the past couple months, 
                we’ve launched new coursework around technical interviewing (Intro to Interviewing) 
                along with courses for web development (Intro to Webpages) on an entirely new surface (desktop)  
                We definitely have more work to do and we will continue to prioritize content that is relevant for 
                beginner coders. Since we have an experimental approach to making content to keep our students motivated, 
                we don’t announce new material too far ahead of time, but stay tuned for more!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fag-2">
            <h3>What languages does Grasshopper support?</h3>
            <p>Given that we’re still in the early stages of development, 
                the Grasshopper team is focused on providing an English-only experience right now.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fag-2">
            <h3>Will Grasshopper expand to teaching other programming languages?</h3>
            <p>Grasshopper currently teaches using the popular programming language JavaScript, used 
                by more than 70% of professional developers. Grasshopper uses JavaScript to teach fundamental 
                programming concepts that are universal to almost all programming languages. Right now, Grasshopper 
                is focusing on deepening our students' understanding of these fundamental coding concepts, and we don’t 
                yet have plans to expand our support to other programming languages.</p>

        <div class="fag-2">
            <h3>What should I do if I want to delete my Grasshopper account?</h3>
            <p>You can do this in Grasshopper on Desktop and Android. 
                Just navigate to the Settings page in the menu and select 'Delete account'.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fag-2">
            <h3>I'd like to get a copy of my account, progress and playground creations, so I can use it outside of Grasshopper. What should I do?</h3>
            <p>Just email grasshopper-support@google.com using the same email address as your Grasshopper account, and we're happy to send you a JSON file with your Grasshopper data.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fag-2">
            <h3>Is Grasshopper available on iOS?</h3>
            <p>The Grasshopper iOS app was temporarily removed from the Apple App Store in March 2022. The team is working hard to improve the app and 
                will release a new version on the App Store later in 2022. Anyone who already has the iOS app installed before March 2022 will be able to 
                continue using the app without issues.</p>
